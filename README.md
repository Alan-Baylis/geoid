# geoid

An augmented reality globe application in Python and OpenCV, as well as a ocean current visulization project in Javascript/WebGL.

These are Steven Ruppert's final projects for **EGGN 512 Computer Vision** and **CSCI 547 Scientific Visulization** in the Spring 2013 semester at the Colorado School of Mines.

## Contents

* `android`: an Android application that draws a camera frame through OpenGL ES 2.0.
* `images`: older training images, not used.
* `octave`: some code to pull and process the ocean dataset from ECCO2 for the WebGL project.
* `python`: the main AR globe application and supporting code.
* `training`: raw and cropped training images for the `geoid.py` program in the `python` directory.
* `webgl`: the ocean current visualization program, also hosted at <http://blendmaster.github.io/geoid/>
