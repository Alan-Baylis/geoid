# geoid

An augmented reality globe application in Python and OpenCV, as well as a ocean current visulization project in Javascript/WebGL.

These are Steven Ruppert's final projects for **EGGN 512 Computer Vision** and **CSCI 547 Scientific Visulization** in the Spring 2013 semester at the Colorado School of Mines.

## Contents

* The `android` directory contains an Android application that draws a camera frame through OpenGL ES 2.0.
* The `images` directory contains older training images, not used.
* The `octave` directory contains some code to pull and process the ocean dataset from ECCO2 for the WebGL project.
* The `python` directory contains the main AR globe application and supporting code.
* The `training` directory contains raw and cropped training images for the `geoid.py` program in the `python` directory.
* The `webgl` directory contains the ocean current visualization program, also hosted at <http://blendmaster.github.io/geoid/>
